### Binned Cast Plot
***

This plot shows the VPR data which has been associated with ROI images and binned according to the input bin size. The bins are then subdivided into up and down casts. This process is done automatically by an oce function and can sometimes struggle to identify the proper cast structure if the tow-yo has smaller depth variations. 

This plot can be useful to identify issues in the binning and cast identification process. It can also help you identify if there have been bins automatically removed due to a lack of ROI images.
