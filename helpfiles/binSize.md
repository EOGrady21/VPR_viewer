### Bin Size

***
This input should reflect the desired bin size which will be used to aggregate the data before visualization. 
Bin size is in meters. 


A larger bin size can be helpful to visualize broad trends. A smaller bin size can be helpful to visualize smaller scale trends. A typical bin size is 5, a bin size below 2 may not be helpful. 


*Example:*

If your bin size is set to 5, each single point on the plots displayed will represent a 5m deep bin of data.
