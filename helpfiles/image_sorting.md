### Image Sorting
***

These options allow you to sort the gallery images by size. All valid ROI images within your data subset will be checked for dimensions and the gallery will display the largest or smallest based on your selection and the number of images you have chosen to show. 

The default option is to sort the ROI images by time so you will see them chronologically, within your data subset.

Note that ROI images are loaded in by column so if viewing the images in order, the images should be read top to bottom of each column left to right, rather than left to right in rows. 

Sorting the images by size can take up to 5 minutes depending on the number of images in your dataset, the metadata for each individual file needs to be read in. Please be patient.
